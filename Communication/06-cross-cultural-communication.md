## 💼 Professional Etiquette

### Email Communication

```
Subject: Question about the Frontend Position

Hi Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to follow up on my interview
last week for the Senior Frontend role.

I'm very excited about the opportunity to work on your React platform.
Quick question: what's the expected timeline for the next steps?

Thanks so much!
Best,
Salman
```

**European Style:**
```

Dear Ms. Johnson,

Thank you for taking the time to interview me last Tuesday for the
Senior Frontend Engineer position.

I remain very interested in the role and would appreciate an update on
the timeline for the next stages of the process.

Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Kind regards,
Salman Rahman
```

**Key Differences:**
- American: Casual, friendly, first names
- European: Formal initially, more structured

### Video Interview Etiquette

**Universal Best Practices:**
```
✅ DO:
- Test tech 30 min before (audio, video, internet)
- Professional background (plain wall, bookshelf, virtual)
- Good lighting (face clearly visible)
- Eye contact (look at camera, not screen)
- Professional attire (at least from waist up)
- Minimize distractions (silent phone, quiet room)
- Smile and show engagement
- Arrive 2-3 minutes early

❌ DON'T:
- Eat or drink (water is okay)

```

**Cultural Adjustments:**

### Slack/Chat Etiquette

**Response Time Expectations:**
- **US Companies:** Quick responses expected (within hours)
- **European:** Respect off-hours, next-day okay
- **Asian:** Varies by company, often faster responses

**Tone:**
```
✅ PROFESSIONAL:
"Hi team, I've completed the PR review. Found a few minor issues that
I've commented on. Let me know if you have questions!"

❌ TOO CASUAL:
"yo done with review. u got some bugs lol fix them"

❌ TOO FORMAL:
"Dear Colleagues, I hope this message finds you well. I have completed
the review of your pull request and identified several areas requiring
attention..."
```

**Emoji Usage:**
- **US:** Common and accepted 👍 ✅ 🎉
- **Europe:** Moderate use, professional contexts
- **Asia:** Varies widely, observe team norms

## 🗣️ Handling Language Barriers

### When You Don't Understand

**Instead of staying silent:**
```
✅ GOOD:
"I'm sorry, could you please repeat that? I want to make sure I
understand correctly."

"Just to clarify, you're asking about [paraphrase]. Is that correct?"

"I'm not familiar with that term. Could you explain what you mean by
[term]?"

"Could you speak a bit slower? I want to make sure I catch all the
details."
```

**Paraphrasing for Confirmation:**
```
Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to refactor a complex codebase."

You: "Just to make sure I understand - you'd like me to share an
experience where I restructured or improved existing code that was
complicated or difficult to maintain. Is that right?"

Interviewer: "Yes, exactly."

You: "Great, let me tell you about..."
```

### When Interviewer Has Accent

**Strategies:**
- Focus on content, not accent
- Watch for visual cues (if video)
- Don't mock or mimic accent
- Ask for repetition if needed
- Be patient and respectful

```
✅ RESPECTFUL:
"I apologize, I didn't catch that last part. Could you please repeat?"

❌ RUDE:
"I can't understand your accent. Can someone else interview me?"
```

### Building Technical Vocabulary

**Common Technical Terms Across Accents:**
Practice understanding these words in different accents:
- Algorithm, architecture, authentication
- Cache, compiler, component
- Database, deployment, debugging
- Performance, prototype, production
- Variable, vulnerability, virtualization

**Resources:**
- Watch tech talks from speakers worldwide (Indian, British, Chinese accents)
- Join international Discord/Slack communities
- Practice with iTalki tutors from different countries

---

## 🤝 Building Rapport Across Cultures

### Small Talk Topics

**SAFE topics (universal):**
- Weather: "How's the weather in [city]?"
- Work setup: "How's your remote work setup?"
- Technology: "What's your favorite dev tool?"
- Learning: "What technologies are you learning?"
- Hobbies: "What do you do outside of coding?"

**AVOID topics:**
- Politics, religion
- Salary/money (until offer stage)
- Personal relationships
- Controversial current events
- Health issues

### Showing Interest in Company Culture

**Good Questions to Ask:**
```
"I noticed your team is distributed globally. How do you handle
timezone differences?"

"What does a typical day look like for the engineering team?"

"How does the team collaborate on projects?"

"I see the company has offices in [country]. Do teams collaborate
across locations?"

"What's the onboarding process like for remote/international employees?"
```

## 📊 Time Zone Management

### Scheduling Interviews

**If in different timezone:**
```
Email Template:

"Thank you for the interview invitation. I'm currently based in [your
timezone], which is [X hours] ahead/behind [their timezone].

I'm flexible with timing and happy to accommodate your schedule. I'm
available:
- [Their time] on [dates] (which is [your time] for me)
- [Their time] on [dates]

Please let me know what works best for your team."
```

**During Interview:**
- Don't complain about early/late time
- Appear energetic regardless of your local time
- Test tech beforehand (different time = different internet traffic)

### Working Across Timezones

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ DO:
- State your timezone in Slack status
- Convert times: "Let's meet at 3pm EST (8pm GMT)"
- Use tools: World Time Buddy, Google Calendar timezone feature
- Respect off-hours (don't expect instant responses at night)
- Document decisions (for async colleagues)

❌ DON'T:
- Assume everyone is in your timezone
- Schedule meetings without checking others' availability
- Send urgent messages outside work hours
- Forget to convert times
```
